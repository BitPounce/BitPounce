BitPounce is a unity like game engine, Currently not much is implemented.

## Getting Started
VS 2022 or gcc is recommended, BitPounce is untested on other environments.

<ins>**1. Downloading the repository:**</ins>
Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/BitPounce/BitPounce`.

<ins>**2. Configuring the dependencies:**</ins>
Run the [Setup.py](https://github.com/BitPounce/BitPounce/blob/main/scripts/Setup.py) file found in `scripts` folder. (For windows run it in a VS 2022 command prompt)

##  The Plan
The plan for BitPounce is to make a powerful easy to use 3D engine.

### Main features to come:
- A full 3D and 2D Editor.
- High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering (this will be expanded later, 2D to come first)
- Fully scripted interaction and behaviour
- Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine

## Short term goals:
**Note: this is subject to change at any time! Follow the roadmap over at [https://app.milanote.com/1VBm1A1Gl7fl2D/bp?p=1TgyLVuL7vU](http://bit.ly/4slZQ6Q).**
By May, I want to make a game using the BitPounce game engine. This means I need to add a full 2D (Or 3D) workflow:

- Design the game scene by using **PounceEdit**, the **BitPounce** editor,
- Test the game inside **PounceEdit**, including the ability to save/load the created game,
- Load and play the game inside **Sandbox**.
I want everyone to be able to play the game on all desktop platforms (Windows, Mac and Linux).
